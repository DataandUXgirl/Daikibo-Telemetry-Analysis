# Project Background
Daikibo is a multinational manufacturing company operating factories across Tokyo, Osaka, Berlin, and Shenzhen. Each location operates 9 types of machines, which send telemetry messages every 10 minutes.


The data analyzed covers one month (May 2021) and was collected to answer the following business questions:


1. In which location did machines break the most?
2. What are the machines that broke most often in that location?


Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- **Category 1:** Down Time per Factory
- **Category 2:** Down Time per Device Type 




An interactive Tableau dashboard used to report and explore machine down time trends can be found here [[link](https://public.tableau.com/views/Book1_17442576765920/Dashboard13?:language=en-GB&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)].


# Data Structure & Initial Checks

The company's main telemetry data was collected from 4 factories, each with 9 types of machines, recorded every 10 minutes for one month (May 2021). The data was provided in a single JSON file and imported into Tableau.

JSON file contains telemetry messages per machine.
Total Records: [X records – dependent on dataset]

# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

Explain the overarching findings, trends, and themes in 2-3 sentences here. This section should address the question: "If a stakeholder were to take away 3 main insights from your project, what are the most important things they should know?" You can put yourself in the shoes of a specific stakeholder - for example, a marketing manager or finance director - to think creatively about this section.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
